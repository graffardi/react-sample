# react-sample
react-sample is a quick start React application.

I use this repository as a reminder of some ReactJS rules, and I am keeping it as an alternative skeleton to create-react-app.

***In order to follow the good practices, I recommend using the create-react-app, this repository just fits my preferences.***
